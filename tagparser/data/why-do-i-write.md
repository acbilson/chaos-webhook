After nearly three years of writing business insights for my MBA program, I've developed the writing habit. I've also passed from my twenties to my thirties and feel, perhaps for the first time, that I may have something to contribute to "the world". Writing to a global audience would paralyze me, so I've narrowed my purpose. If you find my posts helpful but aren't my target audience, what an encouraging side benefit.

Habits have been a challenge for me all my life. A new habit develops, sticks, then some life change happens and it gets lost in the transition. Sometimes I restart, but it's a lot of intention-energy and I don't have much to spare. So these are reasons why I want to keep at the writing habit.

### To Whom I Write

1. I write to myself. Writing helps me process, remember, and communicate what I've learned. Ideas don't become communicable until I've argued them out on paper. My best thoughts are full of holes, and I welcome constructive feedback. I refuse trolls, but I pledge to welcome and publish all criticism which helps me to grow as a thinker, a writer, and a doer of deeds.

2. I write to my children. They are too young to understand what I learn today, but one day they shall. By then I'll have forgotten what to say or from hindsight bias be incapable of sharing the learning journey. So I write today what they may need tomorrow.


### Duplication is welcome; there's plenty of room

The internet isn't like a crowded room. When you're saying something, it's not like you're talking over someone else. There is actually room for everyone to say however much they want.

### Don't repeat yourself, write it down and share it

It's part of programmer philosophy to write a function once and share it across the project instead of duplicating it. This same philosophy applies to ideas.

### Writing and reading one's writing connects ideas together, sometimes forming new ideas and connections

There's something innovative when ideas from multiple domains are placed together. I'm fairly certain this is Elon Musk's primary strategy for creating new solutions - find a solution in one domain and apply it to another.
