After nearly three years of writing business insights for my MBA program, I've developed the writing habit. I've also passed from my twenties to my thirties and feel, perhaps for the first time, that I may have something to contribute to "the world". Writing to a global audience would paralyze me, so I've narrowed my purpose. If you find my posts helpful but aren't my target audience, what an encouraging side benefit.

Habits have been a challenge for me all my life. A new habit develops, sticks, then some life change happens and it gets lost in the transition. Sometimes I restart, but it's a lot of intention-energy and I don't have much to spare. So these are reasons why I want to keep at the writing habit.

### To Whom I Write

1. I write to myself. Writing helps me process, remember, and communicate what I've learned. Ideas don't become communicable until I've argued them out on paper. My best thoughts are full of holes, and I welcome constructive feedback. I refuse trolls, but I pledge to welcome and publish all criticism which helps me to grow as a thinker, a writer, and a doer of deeds.

2. I write to my children. They are too young to understand what I learn today, but one day they shall. By then I'll have forgotten what to say or from hindsight bias be incapable of sharing the learning journey. So I write today what they may need tomorrow.


### Duplication is welcome; there's plenty of room

The internet isn't like a crowded room. When you're saying something, it's not like you're talking over someone else. There is actually room for everyone to say however much they want.

### Don't repeat yourself, write it down and share it

It's part of programmer philosophy to write a function once and share it across the project instead of duplicating it. This same philosophy applies to ideas.

### Writing and reading one's writing connects ideas together, sometimes forming new ideas and connections

There's something innovative when ideas from multiple domains are placed together. I'm fairly certain this is Elon Musk's primary strategy for creating new solutions - find a solution in one domain and apply it to another.

### Write for intellectual stimulation

Something David Perell said about his experience sticks with me.

Writing on the Internet is the best way to solve intellectual loneliness because sharing ideas in public turns you into a magnet for like-minded people.

What does David mean by sharing in public? Sharing his writing on Twitter or Facebook? Probably in part. See Nolan Lawson's experience after [Five years of quitting Twitter](https://nolanlawson.com/2022/02/02/five-years-of-quitting-twitter/) for what happens when you go from being on Twitter to away from it.

I've found eschewing the central hubs doesn't make me a very strong magnet. But as I've meandered through the web outside these hubs, I've discovered some wonderful writing and ideas that's given me a lot of intellectual stimulation. But it's still not a conversation.

Thinking about this further and inspired by the topics I most often write about, I drew up this diagram of the topics that are often on my mind. I was looking for inspiration for the kinds of conversations I'd like to have with others. Maybe if I can identify what they are, I can more readily see when there's an opportunity to engage someone in them?

This is what I've observed so far.

- Tags aren't necessarily the most accurate description of my favorite subjects. I have seven posts about taxes, but that's not a subject I want to discuss with anyone.
- Contribution is a large part of what motivates me. Understanding myself is the other.
- I've found a cadre of really amazing people in technology, and a couple in entrepreneurial pursuits or leadership, but it's a weak area. There's a mix in writing, but I'm nervous about those conversations for some reason. I don't have any contacts for formation, spiritual gifts, or the Church.
- Because my interests are diverse, part of me wants to find people well-versed in every subject I care about. But they don't exist. Being willing to engage in single topics is necessary.

### Write for research

To learn and explore the world around me. As I've moved my website from a typical blog to a digital garden, the Obsidian-style format has changed the way I interact with my existing content. I'm more curious about the edges left unexplored and the connections between concepts. I'm also more likely to stare at what's already there instead of adding new content. Not sure if that's a good thing or now...

It may be that writing for intellectual stimulation **is** writing for research.
