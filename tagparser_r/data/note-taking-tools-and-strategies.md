A broad review of note-taking strategies for long-form writing was conducted by Baldur Bjarnason in a three-part series as part of his [Colophon Cards](https://www.colophon.cards) project.

Before reading Baldur's excellent research, you should know that {{< backref src="/plants/writing/notes-are-a-means-to-an-end" >}}.

In a survey, Baldur synthesized the various ways people use note-taking into the management of either {{< backref src="/plants/writing/note-taking-answers-three-questions" name="Creativity, Knowledge, or Understanding" >}}. These categories broadly divide the note-taking tool market and the ends that people seek when using a new tool.
